# rag4j

rag4j is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine. Unlike Dify, Ragflow and so on, it is developed in Java. Similar products on the market are mostly developed in Python. I hope that I can help developers who use Java as their main development language to better understand the overall mechanism of RAG  through this project.
